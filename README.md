# STEDNet-Weather-Nowcasting

This project was submitted to the ClimateHackAI 2022 hackathon qualifiers where it beat all teams (including PhDs) from MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Oxford, Cambridge, and 11 other unis. Was later sponsored to fly to Harvard University, Boston, to compete in the finals.

Built low compute Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder using time-series satellite imagery to improve weather now-casting for solar grid scheduling.

The pdf contains a good overview of the problem and solution, the folders each contain individual versions submitted to the competition, and training.ipynb is the main workspace where the training loop was run.
